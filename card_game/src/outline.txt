
PLAN FOR GAME IS AS FOLLOWS:

    How the game is played:
        1. The game is launched when the program begins.
        2. The player and dealer(non-player) will be given a hand drawn randomly from a deck of cards.
        3. The player will have the option to hit or stay until they bust or win.
        4. The game ends when the player either wins or loses. There will be a prompt asking if they 
        wish to play again.
        5. The game and program ends when the player specifies the termination command at the end of a game.

    Structure of the program:
        1. There are three primary classes: Deck, Card, and Participant.
            Deck:
                1. Deck should be in charge of generating a deck of valid cards with values and suits, 
            with no repetition.
                a. maybe there should be a shuffle command?
            Card:
                1. Card contains the information for an individual card, which is the value and suit. 
            Participant:
                1. Participant should contain a hand of cards to play with.
        2. The deck of cards is generated like so:
            a. There will be a loop that creates an initial deck of cards in the same order each time.
                - the function to create a card should be made in the Card class.
            b. The cards are placed into a deck, and then another function shall randomly rearrange the cards.
                - this is our shuffle function.
            c. Once the deck has been shuffled, cards can then be given to participants' hands.
